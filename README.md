# ENGR845 Term Project: ZonePulse (AI) Device
This repo is meant to archive any source code, presentation files, reports, and notes that were used for the term project in ENGR845: Neural Machine Interface.

## Overview

This project is an attempt to create a smartwatch prototype that primarily measures your heart rate. Once it measures your 

### Consensus Reasons for this project
Here are some of the motives for this project.
1. The concept of having a heart rate device has peaked interest.
2. Heart diseases can be tricky to diagnose, as not all patients display the same symptoms as each other.
3. There's a lack of a more personalized workout regiment that's tailored to each specific user.

The third motive for this project is particularly important, because we want to have a device that's more customizable to the user based on their exercising efforts. To do this, we plan on integrating heart rate exercise zones that uses colors to notify the user about their exercising efforts. 

### How does the project work?
The device's goal is to create an affordable, standalone heart rate training device that learns from each user's actual workout performance to provide personalized training zone guidance through simple visual and audio feedback.
This can simplfy the need for complex smartphone apps or expensive premium fitness technology while delivering more effective workouts with less guesswork and fewer distractions. 

It works by measuring the user's heart rate and categorizes the heart rate into the five exercise zones. The zones are based on a certain percentage threshold of the person's maximum heart rate. 
For example, Zone 1 would be between 50-60% of the user's maximum heart rate. This would mean that the person is under warmup/recovery session.
