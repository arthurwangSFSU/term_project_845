# ENGR845 Term Project: ZonePulse (AI) Device
This repo is meant to archive any source code, presentation files, reports, and notes that were used for the term project in ENGR845: Neural Machine Interface.

## Overview

This project is an attempt to create a affordable device that's focused on multiple topics related to the human heart.

### Consensus Reasons for this project
Here are some of the motives for this project.
1. The concept of having a heart rate device has peaked interest.
2. Heart diseases can be tricky to diagnose, as not all patients display the same symptoms as each other.
3. There's a lack of a more personalized workout regiment that's tailored to each specific user.

The third motive for this project is particularly important, because we want to have a device that's more customizable to the user based on their exercising efforts. To do this, we plan on integrating heart rate exercise zones that uses colors to notify the user about their exercising efforts.
